# hello-world

## Hi, I'm going to learn how to code and think like a software engineer. 

There's not much to my reason, I've always just thought that being able to build an application or software using some programming language and a bit of thinking was always cool.

I'd imagine I have alot to learn, but anything worthy while doesn't come easy. 

Thanks for reading!
